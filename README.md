# DelphiFastGeo
## FastGeo is an advanced Geometry Library in Delphi by Arash Partow  
FastGeo is a huge and fast geometry library invented by Arash Partow in 1997. 
In 1998 I used it in some of my private Delphi-projects. In 2005 I needed it in Visual Basic too, so I 
ported the Code from Delphi to VB. I contacted Arash Partow to let him know of my port to VB, he showed 
me his port to C++ he calles it Wykobi. You can find Arash Partow and his projects FastGeo and Wykobi
